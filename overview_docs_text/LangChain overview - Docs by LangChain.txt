LangChain is an open source framework with a pre-built agent architecture and
integrations for any model or tool — so you can build agents that adapt as fast
as the ecosystem evolves
LangChain is the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs.
With under 10 lines of code, you can connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and .
LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get
started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.
We recommend you use LangChain if you want to quickly build agents and autonomous
applications. Use , our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime,
when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and
agentic workflows, heavy customization, and carefully controlled latency.
LangChain  are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution,
streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. You do not need to know
LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.

See the  and  to get started building your own
agents and applications with LangChain.
import * as z from "zod";
// npm install @langchain/anthropic to call the model
import { createAgent, tool } from "langchain";
const getWeather = tool(
  ({ city }) => `It's always sunny in ${city}!`,
  {
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Get the weather for a given city",
    schema: z.object({
      city: z.string(),
    }),
  },
);
const agent = createAgent({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  tools: [getWeather],
});
console.log(
  await agent.invoke({
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What's the weather in Tokyo?" }],
  })
);

 or .
 to Claude, VSCode, and more via MCP for real-time answers.
Different providers have unique APIs
for interacting with models, including
the format of responses. LangChain
standardizes how you interact with
models so that you can seamlessly
swap providers and avoid lock-in.
LangChainʼs agent abstraction is
designed to be easy to get started
with, letting you build a simple agent
in under 10 lines of code. But it also
provides enough flexibility to allow
you to do all the context engineering
your heart desires.
LangChainʼs agents are built on top
of LangGraph. This allows us to take
advantage of LangGraphʼs durable
execution, human-in-the-loop
support, persistence, and more.
Gain deep visibility into complex
agent behavior with visualization
tools that trace execution paths,
capture state transitions, and provide
detailed runtime metrics.
