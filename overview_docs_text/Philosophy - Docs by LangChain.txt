LangChain exists to be the easiest place to start building with LLMs, while also
being flexible and production-ready.
LangChain is driven by a few core beliefs:
With LangChain, we have two core focuses:
Large Language Models �LLMs� are great, powerful new technology.
LLMs are even better when you combine them with external sources of data.
LLMs will transform what the applications of the future look like. Specifically, the
applications of the future will look more and more agentic.
It is still very early on in that transformation.
While itʼs easy to build a prototype of those agentic applications, itʼs still really hard to
build agents that are reliable enough to put into production.
Different providers expose different APIs, with different model parameters and
different message formats. Standardizing these model inputs and outputs is a core
focus, making it easy for developer to easily change to the most recent state-of-
the-art model, avoiding lock-in.

Given the constant rate of change in the field, LangChain has also evolved over time.
Below is a brief timeline of how LangChain has changed over the years, evolving
alongside what it means to build with LLMs:
Models should be used for more than just text generation - they should also be
used to orchestrate more complex flows that interact with other data. LangChain
makes it easy to define  that LLMs can use dynamically, as well as help with
parsing of and access to unstructured data.
v0.0.1
A month before ChatGPT, . It consisted of two main
components:
The name LangChain comes from “Language” (like Language models) and “Chains”.
LLM abstractions
“Chains”, or predetermined steps of computation to run, for common use cases. For example -
RAG: run a retrieval step, then run a generation step.
The first general purpose agents were added to LangChain.
These general purpose agents were based on the  �ReAct standing for Reasoning and
Acting). They used LLMs to generate JSON that represented tool calls, and then parsed that JSON to
determine what tools to call.
OpenAI releases a ‘Chat Completionʼ API.

Previously, models took in strings and returned a string. In the ChatCompletions API, they evolved to
take in a list of messages and return a message. Other model providers followed suit, and LangChain
updated to work with lists of messages.
LangChain releases a JavaScript version.
LLMs and agents will change how applications are built and JavaScript is the language of application
developers.
 around the open source LangChain project.
The main goal was to “make intelligent agents ubiquitous”. The team recognized that while LangChain
was a key part �LangChain made it simple to get started with LLMs), there was also a need for other
components.
OpenAI releases ‘function callingʼ in their API.
This allowed the API to explicitly generate payloads that represented tool calls. Other model providers
followed suit, and LangChain was updated to use this as the preferred method for tool calling (rather
than parsing JSON�.
 as closed source platform by LangChain Inc., providing observability and evals
The main issue with building agents is getting them to be reliable, and LangSmith, which provides
observability and evals, was built to solve that need. LangChain was updated to integrate seamlessly
with LangSmith.

v0.1.0
, its first non-0.0.x.
The industry matured from prototypes to production, and as such, LangChain increased its focus on
stability.
 as an open-source library.
The original LangChain had two focuses: LLM abstractions, and high-level interfaces for getting
started with common applications; however, it was missing a low-level orchestration layer that allowed
developers to control the exact flow of their agent. Enter: LangGraph.
When building LangGraph, we learned from lessons when building LangChain and added functionality
we discovered was needed: streaming, durable execution, short-term memory, human-in-the-loop,
and more.
Integrations were split out of the core LangChain package, and either moved into their own
standalone packages (for the core integrations) or .

LangGraph becomes the preferred way to build any AI application that is more than a single LLM call.
As developers tried to improve the reliability of their applications, they needed more control than the
high-level interfaces provided. LangGraph provided that low-level flexibility. Most chains and agents
were marked as deprecated in LangChain with guides on how to migrate them to LangGraph. There is
still one high-level abstraction created in LangGraph: an agent abstraction. It is built on top of low-
level LangGraph and has the same interface as the ReAct agents from LangChain.
Model APIs become more multimodal.
Models started to accept files, images, videos, and more. We updated the 
message format accordingly to allow developers to specify these multimodal inputs in a standard way.
v1.0.0
 with two major changes:
��� Complete revamp of all chains and agents in . All chains and agents are now replaced
with only one high level abstraction: an agent abstraction built on top of LangGraph. This was the
high-level abstraction that was originally created in LangGraph, but just moved to LangChain.
For users still using old LangChain chains/agents who do NOT want to upgrade (note: we
recommend you do), you can continue using old LangChain by installing the 
 package.
��� A standard message content format: Model APIs evolved from returning messages with a simple
content string to more complex output types - reasoning blocks, citations, server-side tool calls,
etc. LangChain evolved its message formats to standardize these across providers.
