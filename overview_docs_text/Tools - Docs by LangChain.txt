Tools extend what  can do—letting them fetch real-time data, execute code, query
external databases, and take actions in the world.
Under the hood, tools are callable functions with well-defined inputs and outputs that get
passed to a . The model decides when to invoke a tool based on the
conversation context, and what input arguments to provide.
For details on how models handle tool calls, see .
The simplest way to create a tool is by importing the  function from the 
package. You can use  to define the toolʼs input schema:

Some chat models (e.g., , , and ) feature  that are
executed server-side, such as web search and code interpreters. Refer to the 
 to learn how to access these tools with your specific chat model.
 Tools are most powerful when they can access agent state, runtime
context, and long-term memory. This enables tools to make context-aware decisions,
personalize responses, and maintain information across conversations.
The runtime context provides a structured way to supply runtime data, such as DB
connections, user IDs, or config, into your tools. This avoids global state and keeps tools
testable and reusable.
Tools can access an agentʼs runtime context through the  parameter:
import * as z from "zod"
import { tool } from "langchain"
const searchDatabase = tool(
  ({ query, limit }) => `Found ${limit} results for '${query}'`,
  {
    name: "search_database",
    description: "Search the customer database for records matching the query."
    schema: z.object({
      query: z.string().describe("Search terms to look for"),
      limit: z.number().describe("Maximum number of results to return"),
    }),
  }
);

Access persistent data across conversations using the store. The store is accessed via
import * as z from "zod"
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai"
import { createAgent } from "langchain"
const getUserName = tool(
  (_, config) => {
    return config.context.user_name
  },
  {
    name: "get_user_name",
    description: "Get the user's name.",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }
);
const contextSchema = z.object({
  user_name: z.string(),
});
const agent = createAgent({
  model: new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" }),
  tools: [getUserName],
  contextSchema,
});
const result = await agent.invoke(
  {
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is my name?" }]
  },
  {
    context: { user_name: "John Smith" }
  }
);

 and allows you to save and retrieve user-specific or application-specific
data.
Stream custom updates from tools as they execute using . This is
useful for providing real-time feedback to users about what a tool is doing.
import * as z from "zod";
import { createAgent, tool } from "langchain";
import { InMemoryStore } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
const store = new InMemoryStore();
// Access memory
