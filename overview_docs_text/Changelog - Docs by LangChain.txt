Log of updates and improvements to our JavaScript/TypeScript packages
: Our changelog includes an  that can integrate with , ,
Discord bots like  or , and other subscription tools.
Introducing  - a cleaner, library-agnostic way to define graph state that works with any
-compliant validation library.
LangGraph now supports , an open specification implemented by Zod 4,
Valibot, ArkType, and other schema libraries. This means you can use your preferred validation library
without lock-in:

New exported type utilities for typing functions outside the graph builder:
: Define fields with custom reducers for accumulating values. Supports separate
input and output schemas for type-safe reducer inputs.
: Define transient state that exists during execution but is never checkpointed -
useful for database connections, caches, or runtime-only configuration.
: A prebuilt  for chat messages with the standard messages
reducer.
import { z } from "zod"; // or valibot, arktype, etc.
import { StateSchema, ReducedValue, MessagesValue } from "@langchain/langgraph"
const AgentState = new StateSchema({
  messages: MessagesValue,
  currentStep: z.string(),
  count: z.number().default(0),
  history: new ReducedValue(
    z.array(z.string()).default(() => []),
    {
      inputSchema: z.string(),
      reducer: (current, next) => [...current, next],
    }
  ),
});
// Type-safe state and update types
type State = typeof AgentState.State;
type Update = typeof AgentState.Update;
const graph = new StateGraph(AgentState)
  .addNode("agent", (state) => ({ count: state.count + 1 }))
  .addEdge(START, "agent")
  .addEdge("agent", END)
  .compile();

The existing  and zod-based API continues to work unchanged -  is an
additional option for those who prefer schema-first definitions.
 - Type node functions with full inference
 - Type conditional edge routers
See the full documentation for defining graph state with StateSchema,
ReducedValue, and UntrackedValue.
Use GraphNode and ConditionalEdgeRouter to type functions outside the graph
builder.
// Type standalone node functions
const myNode: GraphNode<typeof AgentState> = (state, config) => {
  return { count: state.count + 1 };
};
// Use schema type helpers directly
const processState = (state: typeof AgentState.State) => {
  console.log(state.count);
};

: Chat models now expose supported features and capabilities through a
 getter. These data are derived from , an open source project providing
model capability data.
: New middleware for automatically retrying failed model calls with
configurable exponential backoff, improving agent reliability.
: OpenAI content moderation middleware for detecting and
handling unsafe content in agent interactions. Supports checking user input, model output, and
tool results.
: Updated to support flexible trigger points using model profiles for
context-aware summarization.
:  support (native structured output) can now be inferred
from model profiles.
: Support for passing  instances directly to
ʼs  parameter and a new  method for extending system
messages. Enables advanced features like cache control and structured content blocks.
: Return values from  are
now purely additive. When returning a  or , they are merged with existing
system messages rather than replacing them, making it easier to compose multiple middleware
that modify the prompt.
 Fixed error handling for Zod v4 validation errors in structured
output and tool schemas, ensuring detailed error messages are properly displayed.
